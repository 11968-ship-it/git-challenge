# Abdulrahman 💡♟️🛠️

**## About Me**
- Current Status: Student at Holberton School, transitioning from administrative work to infrastructure engineering
- Learning Focus: Shell and C programming
- Working Style: Methodical systems thinker - I like understanding the big picture before diving in

**## What Drives Me**
I'm fascinated by how well-structured systems make complex problems manageable. My background in administrative roles taught me the value of efficient systems, something i now apply to software engineering

**## Projects & Interests**
- Building practical tools that improve learning and collaboration workflows
- Finding ways to optimize processes through thoughtful code organization
- Exploring prompt engineering as a way to bridge communication gaps

**## Just For Fun**
In every job i did, I spent more time refining workflows than actually doing the work, cutting friction, minimizing errors, and streamlining every step.
